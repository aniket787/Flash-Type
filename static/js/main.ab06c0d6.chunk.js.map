Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.\",\r\n    \"Paragraph development continues with an elaboration on the controlling idea, perhaps with an explanation, implication, or statement about significance. Our example offers a possible explanation for the pervasiveness of the myth.\",\r\n    \"The next movement in paragraph development is an explanation of each example and its relevance to the topic sentence. The explanation should demonstrate the value of the example as evidence to support the major claim, or focus, in your paragraph\",\r\n    \"The final movement in paragraph development involves tying up the loose ends of the paragraph. At this point, you can remind your reader about the relevance of the information to the larger paper, or you can make a concluding point for this example. You might, however, simply transition to the next paragraph.\",\r\n];","import React from 'react';\r\nimport ChallengeSection from '../ChallengeSection/ChallengeSection';\r\nimport Footer from '../Footer/Footer';\r\nimport Landing from '../Landing/Landing';\r\nimport Nav from '../Nav/Nav';\r\nimport \"./App.css\";\r\nimport { SAMPLE_PARAGRAPHS } from '../../Data/SampleParagraph';\r\n\r\nconst TotalTime = 60;\r\nconst ServiceUrl =\"http://metaphorpsum.com/paragraphs/1/9\";\r\nconst DefaultState = {\r\n    selectedParagraph: '',\r\n    timerStarted: false,\r\n    timerRemaining: TotalTime,\r\n    words: 0,\r\n    characters: 0,\r\n    wpm: 0,\r\n    testInfo: [],\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass App extends React.Component {\r\n\r\n\r\n    state = DefaultState;\r\n\r\nfetchNewParagraphFallBack =()=> {\r\n    const data = SAMPLE_PARAGRAPHS[\r\n        Math.floor(Math.random()* SAMPLE_PARAGRAPHS.length)\r\n    ];\r\n    const selectedParagraphArray = data.split(\"\");\r\n    const testInfo = selectedParagraphArray.map(selectedLetter => {\r\n        return {\r\n            testLetter: selectedLetter,\r\n            status: \"notAttempted\",\r\n        }\r\n    })\r\n    this.setState({ ...DefaultState, testInfo, selectedParagraph: data })\r\n\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nfetchNewParagraph =() =>{\r\n    fetch(ServiceUrl)\r\n        .then(response => response.text())\r\n        .then(data => {\r\n            this.setState({ selectedParagraph: data })\r\n          \r\n        })\r\n\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n    componentDidMount () {\r\n        this.fetchNewParagraphFallBack();\r\n\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    startTimer = () =>{\r\n        this.setState({timerStarted: true});\r\n        const timer = setInterval(()=>{\r\n            if(this.state.timerRemaining>0){\r\n                // change the wpm as well\r\n                const timeSpent = TotalTime - this.state.timerRemaining;\r\n                const wpm = timeSpent > 0 \r\n                ?(this.state.words / timeSpent) * TotalTime \r\n                : 0;\r\n                this.setState({\r\n                    timerRemaining: this.state.timerRemaining - 1,\r\n                    wpm: parseInt(wpm),\r\n                });\r\n\r\n            }else{\r\n                clearInterval(timer)\r\n            }\r\n           \r\n\r\n        }, 1000);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    startAgain = () => this.fetchNewParagraphFallBack();\r\n    handleUserInput = (inputValue) =>{\r\n       if(!this.state.timerStarted) this.startTimer();\r\n\r\n\r\n    //     handle under flow test - all characters chould be shown unattempted\r\n\r\n\r\n    //  handle overflow case-  early exit \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    //  handle backspace - mark the index +1 element as not attempted\r\n\r\n    // update - update the status in test info     find last charv in inputvalue and its index\r\n            //  - check if character at same index as stateinfo matches or not \r\n\r\n        const characters = inputValue.length;\r\n        const words = inputValue.split(\" \").length;\r\n        const index = characters - 1;\r\n\r\n        if (index < 0) {\r\n            this.setState({\r\n                testInfo: [\r\n                    {\r\n                        testLetter: this.state.testInfo[0].testLetter,\r\n                        status: \"notAttempted\",\r\n                    },\r\n                    ...this.state.testInfo.slice(1),\r\n                ],\r\n                characters,\r\n                words,\r\n            });\r\n\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (index >= this.state.selectedParagraph.length) {\r\n            this.setState({ characters, words });\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Make a copy of testInfo\r\n        const testInfo = this.state.testInfo;\r\n        if (!(index === this.state.selectedParagraph.length - 1))\r\n            testInfo[index + 1].status = \"notAttempted\";\r\n\r\n        // Check for the correct typed letter\r\n        const isCorrect = inputValue[index] === testInfo[index].testLetter;\r\n\r\n        // Update the testInfo\r\n        testInfo[index].status = isCorrect ?
